                    When you’re busy leading a team, coding and maintaining
                    standards, how do you find the time to stay ahead of
                    new technologies and develop yourself as a technical lead?
                    Software continues to transform the world in remarkable
                    ways and developers are at the center of it. At CodeMesh 2017
                    we invite you to join us in Sofia to learn about
                    latest new technologies and exciting plans on the horizon.
                    As always, CodeMesh is filled with strong technical sessions
                    as well as opportunities to meet and learn from others in
                    the industry. We’ll make sure the schedule is filled with
                    solid content, and will strive to deliver some fun surprises along the way.
